.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents
.Ql $Revision$
of the 
.Nm
program. 

Gerber numeric code files are basically text files but do not contain
line breaks, which makes them hard to read. This utility can be used
to display the file in a more human-readable format.

First it prints a line with the name of the file. Then it prints all
the numeric codes in the file, one per line.
